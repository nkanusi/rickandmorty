This project made a call to the rick and porty api and displayed the data on screen by
■ Character name
■ Species
■ Status
■ Gender
■ Date created

I also added a dropdown to be used as a way to select items by status
I used useEffect and useState.
I also used an async and await with fetch to query the API
